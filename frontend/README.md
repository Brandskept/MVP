# Frontend

This directory contains a starter [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application.
It is configured with **Tailwind CSS** and is ready for [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.

## Local Development

Install dependencies (requires Node.js and access to npm registry):

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To scaffold shadcn/ui components after installing dependencies, run:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

This project was generated offline, so no node modules are included.
