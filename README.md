# MVP

This repository contains planning documents for the BrandSkept project.
A starter Next.js app lives in the `frontend/` directory.

## Getting Started

From the repository root run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app uses Tailwind CSS and is ready for shadcn/ui components.
You can initialize shadcn/ui after dependencies are installed with:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

The project was created offline, so node modules are not included.
